# FaceDetection
It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.

Here we will deal with face and eye detection.First, the algorithm is trained with a large number of positive and negative images, and then the Haar features are extracted from it to recognize the face and eyes.

The extracted Haar features are grouped in different stages of classification and applied to a window of the image.The extracted features are grouped in different stages of classification and applied to a window of the image.
